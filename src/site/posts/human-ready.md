You will need to sign a [Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://docs.geneticscores.org/data/dpa) before uploading your data. The DPA is a legal contract which outlines the roles and obligations of the service user and us (the data processor) and it describes how the data will be handled, processed and protected. Please read the DPA carefully before consenting to ensure you can comply with the terms, and that our processes are suitable for your data.
